Frontend isn't just components—it's about building systems that scale. Here's what I've learned from building apps that serve millions.

## 🏗️ Component Architecture

Think in systems, not components:

```jsx
// Bad - Tightly coupled
function UserProfile() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  // Fetch logic mixed with UI
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser().then(setUser);
  }, []);
  return <Avatar user={user} />;
}

// Good - Separated concerns
function UserProfile() {
  return (
    <UserProvider>
      <UserAvatar />
      <UserDetails />
    </UserProvider>
  );
}
```

## 🔄 State Management Patterns

Choose the right tool for the job:

- **Local state**: `useState` for component-specific data
- **Shared state**: Context for cross-component data
- **Server state**: React Query/TanStack for API data
- **Global state**: Zustand for app-wide state

## 📈 Scalability Patterns

Build for growth from day one:

1. **Component composition** over inheritance
2. **Data fetching abstraction** for easy backend changes
3. **Error boundaries** for graceful degradation
4. **Lazy loading** for performance

These principles helped scale a startup app from **1K** to **1M** users without major rewrites.

Good systems don't just work—they evolve.
