# Hello World 👋

After spending a lot of time solving problems in production systems, debugging weird UI behavior at 2 AM, and learning things the _hard way_, I finally decided to start writing.

This blog is not a tutorial collection.

It is a **thinking log of a working engineer**.

I’ll document:

- mistakes
- tradeoffs
- performance bottlenecks
- architectural decisions
- and why simple solutions sometimes fail at scale

---

## Why this blog exists

Most tutorials teach _how to make something work_.

Production engineering is about:

> Making it work consistently under bad network, real users, large data, and time pressure.

The difference between demo code and production code is enormous.

Example:

A dropdown working locally:

```js
setOpen(!open);
```

A dropdown working in production:

- keyboard accessible
- screen reader friendly
- closes on outside click
- closes on scroll
- closes on route change
- survives React Strict Mode
- survives concurrent rendering
- handles race conditions

Same feature.
Different engineering.

## What I work on

I primarily work around:

### Frontend Architecture

- component isolation
- predictable state
- rendering performance
- scalable folder structures

### Data Heavy UI

Dashboards, filters, pagination, streaming data.

### Performance

- avoiding unnecessary renders
- memoization strategies
- virtualization
- network behavior awareness

### System Thinking (Frontend System Design)

Not backend distributed systems —
but _UI behaving correctly with distributed data_.

## What you can expect

Posts here will be practical and honest.

You’ll see topics like:

- Why cursor pagination beats offset pagination in real dashboards
- Why loading spinners are UX bugs
- Why most custom hooks are wrong
- The cost of useEffect
- Building components that don’t break after 6 months

No hype. No over-engineering. No cargo cult patterns.

---

## Who this is for

If you:

- know React basics
- want to become a strong engineer (not just framework user)
- prepare for frontend interviews
- or build real products

You’ll benefit from this blog.

## Next post

I’ll start with a topic that caused multiple production bugs:

> **Outside Click Detection — The deceptively simple problem**

Because almost every implementation online is subtly broken.

Thanks for reading ✨
